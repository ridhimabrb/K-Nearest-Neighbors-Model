# KNN Classifier Visualizer
A p5.js interactive project that performs k-nearest neighbors classification based on your mouse position.
I created this to demonstrate how machine learning classification works using Euclidean distance logic. As the user moves their cursor across the canvas, the algorithm dynamically calculates distances, selects the closest points and assigns the predicted label (purple or green).
